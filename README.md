# Java Hello World, LLVM Edition

A sample that demonstrates how to use the Java Foreign Function & Memory API by using the LLVM C API as an example.
The small program generates an LLVM module with code to print "Hello, World!", JIT compiles it and executes it from
Java using the FFM API to call the LLVM API.
